# Big data with examples and files.
Big Data is a collection of data that is extremely large which increases over time.
Social media is one of the best example of big data . Facebook posts and Instagram posts, blogs, comments ,transactions data from banks, all come under bigdata.
# Types of Big  data:
There are three categories of big data. They are 
## Structured:
The data which can be accessed in a specific format like tables is called as “structured data”. It is very easy to store, process and analyze and it is in readable format.
Example: The data we generally store in the form of tables by sql queries is one of the best example of structured data as we can read and write the tables easily.
## Semi structured:
Semi structured is the combination of both structured and un structured data. Semi-structured data is stored in text-based formats like XML, JSON, and CSV,
## Unstrcutured:
Unstructured data is defined as any data with an uneven shape or structure. It is very difficult to extract data from unstructured data. There are various kind of unstructured data such as images, videos, audio files, text documents.

# 6 V’s of BIGDATA:
## Volume:
Volume refers to the large amount of data produced by companies, hospitals, stock markets  and others .The volume of the data is a very important factor in determining its value. This means that the “volume” of data will determine whether a given set of data is a big data or not.
## Velocity:
Velocity describes the speed in which data will be generated and used from various resources .For instance Thousands of people will post ,like and share information in Social media in just one second.
## Variety:
It refers of the different forms of data that exist( structured, semi structured, partially structured) and different types like audio, video, text, image  It also refers to various sources that data has been collected from like banks, organizations, hospitals..
## Veracity:
This refers to the quality and accuracy of the data, and the challenges associated with extracting clean data from noise data
## Variability:
This tells how fast a data format can be changed from one to another and how the data will be managed in unpredictable data formats.
## Value:
Value refers to usefulness of data . Converting raw data to something valuable is defined as its “Value”. The vast amount of data without any value is useless to the company unless it is transformed into something beneficial.

# Phases of Big data Analytics:
There are 5 phases in big data analysis:
## Data acquisition and recording: 
Firstly, we have to identify the source of data.Once the source of the data has been identified, the data should be gathered from the sources.Since the data  we collected is unstructured, it needs to be filtered to eliminate corrupted or irrelevant data. After the filtering process, a duplicate of the data is stored for future purposes.
## Information extraction and cleaning : 
During the process of data filtering, some data entries may be incompatible. In this phase, the data entries that do not fit  with the underlying scope of analysis are extracted and transformed. Data cleaning involves filling in missing values and correcting data inconsistencies.
## Data integration, aggregation and representation:
Data integration and aggregation simply involves combining data from several data stores in order to  avoid duplications and inconsistencies  Representation means visualizing the data in many ways,including bar charts, histograms, boxplots, and pie charts.
## Query processing, Data modelling and Analysis:
A data model is a conceptual representation that arranges data objects and defines how they relate to each other. Meaningful information is obtained through queries. However, analyzing data that are not stored in SQL databases can be difficult through SQL queries, which presents a challenge in performing different analysis tasks
## Interpretation: 
Interpretation is the final phase in the big data analytics process. This phase involves verifying results produced by the data analysis and verifying their accuracy.

# Challenges in  Big data Analytics:
## Accessing data and Heterogeneity:
As we have heterogenous data i.e data which is different in format, structure and meaning. This data will result in missing data ,faulty errors and which inturn decrease the data quality , lead to incorrect  conclusions and poor decision making.
## Security:
Security problems are more  when there is more data. When such data is less organized, the issue is made worse. Big data analytics involves the storage and processing of vast amounts of data, including sensitive information such as personal data and financial information. Security challenges can arise due to various factors, such as weak authentication and access control mechanisms, as well as cyber attacks. These security issues can lead to the loss of confidential information and have significant negative consequences.
## Privacy:
Maintaining privacy is a significant challenge in big data analytics due to the large volumes of data involved. Issues can arise regarding who has access to the data, as well as concerns about the sharing of sensitive and personal information.
## Scalability:
Dealing with large datasets is a major concern in big data analytics. As the amount of data grows, the challenges of processing and analyzing also increases. One possible way to solve the problems of big data analytics is to make use of cloud computing. This involves storing and analyzing data on remote servers, which eases the management of large amounts of data and eliminates the investments in hardware and infrastructure
## Integration of data from different sources:
Data can be generated from a variety of sources, such as social media pages, customer logs, financial data, emails, and staff reports. Integrating all of this data and managing can be a challenging task.Ensuring a seamless data integration process is important for effective analysis.
