# Big data with examples and files

Big Data is a collection of data that is extremely large and keeps expanding exponentially over time. Social media is one of the best examples of big data. According to the estimate, Facebook's databases get more than 500 terabytes of new data each day. This information is primarily produced by the uploading of images and videos, messaging, leaving comments, etc.

## Types of Big data

There are three categories of big data. They are:

1. Structured: The term "structured data" refers to any data that can be accessed, stored, and processed in a specific format. One example of "structured" data is data stored in a relational database management system.

2. Semi-structured: Both types of data can be found in semi-structured data. Semi-structured data can appear to be structured, but it is not specified by a relational DBMS's concept of a table, for example. An XML file containing data is an example of semi-structured data.

3. Unstructured: Unstructured data is defined as any data with an undetermined shape or structure. Unstructured data has a number of processing issues that make it difficult to extract value from it, in addition to its enormous bulk. A heterogeneous data source that combines simple text files with photos, movies, and other types of data is a common example of unstructured data.

## The 6 V's of BIGDATA

1. Volume: A large amount of data is called volume. The volume of the data is a very important factor in determining its value. The term "Big Data" is really used to explain the data that is extremely huge in volume. This means that the amount of data will determine whether or not a given set of data may be called big data.

2. Velocity: Velocity describes the high rate of data collection. Data comes from a wide range of sources, including machines, networks, social media, mobile phones, etc., in big data velocity. A significant and constant flow of data is generated. The speed at which data is generated and processed to satisfy demands determines the data's potential. For instance, Google receives more than 3.5 billion queries per day. Additionally, the number of Facebook users is rising by approximately 22% yearly.

3. Variety: It refers to the type of data and the various sources of data. The emergence of data from fresh sources, both inside and outside of a company, is essentially what is meant by variety. It can be organized, partially organized, or unorganized.

4. Veracity: It relates to data redundancy and ambiguity; that is, easily available data can occasionally become disorganized, and quality and accuracy are challenging to manage. As an instance, additional data could cause confusion, whereas less information could only convey partial or incorrect information.

5. Value: The bulk of information that has no value is useless to the firm until it can be made valuable. Data by itself is useless and unimportant; information must be extracted from it by transforming it into something worthwhile. Therefore, we might say that value is the most significant of the six V's.

6. Variability: Data that is constantly changing is referred to as variability. Understanding and correctly interpreting the significance of raw data are the main areas of variation.

## Phases of Big data Analytics

1. Sharing and Accessing data: Accessing data from open sources causes many problems. If data from the company's information system is used to make fast, accurate decisions, then the data should be available in an accurate, full, and timely manner.

2. Security: Security breaches
