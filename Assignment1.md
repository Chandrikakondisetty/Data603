# Big data with examples and files.
Big Data is a collection of data that is extremely large and keeps expanding exponentially over time.
Social media is one of the best example of big data .  According to the estimate, Facebook's databases get more than 500 terabytes of new data each day. This information is primarily produced by the uploading of images and videos, messaging, leaving comments, etc.
Types of Big data:
There are three categories of big data. They are 
1.Structured:
The term "structured data" refers to any data that can be accessed, stored, and processed in a specific format. One example of "structured" data is data stored in a relational database management system.
2.Semi structured:
Both types of data can be found in semi-structured data. Semi-structured data can appear to be structured, but it is not specified by a relational DBMS's concept of a table, for example. An XML file containing data is an example of semi-structured data.
3.Unstrcutured:
Unstructured data is defined as any data with an undetermined shape or structure. Unstructured data has a number of processing issues that make it difficult to extract value from it, in addition to its enormous bulk. A heterogeneous data source that combines simple text files with photos, movies, and other types of data is a common example of unstructured data.

#6 Vâ€™s of BIGDATA:
Volume:
A large amount of data is called volume.The volume of the data is a very important factor in determining its value. The term "Big Data" is really used to explain the data that is extremely huge in volume. This means that the amount of data will determine whether or not a given set of data may be called a big data.
Velocity:
Velocity describes the high rate of data collection.Data comes from a wide range of sources, including machines, networks, social media, mobile phones, etc., in big data velocity.A significant and constant flow of data is generated. The speed at which data is generated and processed to satisfy demands determines the data's potential.For instance, Google receives more than 3.5 billion queries per day. Additionally, the number of Facebook users is rising by approximately 22% yearly


Variety:
It refers of the type of data. It also refers to sources that are various. The emergence of data from fresh sources, both inside and outside of a company, is essentially what is meant by variety. It can be organized, partially organized, or unorganized.
Veracity:
It relates to data redundancy and ambiguity; that is, easily available data can occasionally become disorganized, and quality and accuracy are challenging to manage.
As an instance, additional data could cause confusion, whereas less information could only convey partial or incorrect information.
Value:
The bulk of information that has no value is useless to the firm until you can make it valuable.
Data by itself is useless and unimportant; information must be extracted from it by transforming it into something worthwhile. Therefore, we might say that Value! is the most significant of the six V's.
Variability:
Data that is constantly changing is referred to as variability.  Understanding and correctly interpreting the significance of raw data are the main areas of variation.
#Phases of Big data Analytics:
Sharing and Accessing data:
Accessing data from open sources causes many problems. If data from the company's information system is  used to make fast, accurate decisions, then the data should be available in an accurate, full, and timely manner.
Security:
Security breaches are more likely when there is more data. When such data is less organized, the issue is made worse. There is a higher likelihood for security breakdowns as your organization expands, you add more tools to your software stack, and you implement new technologies to make sense of your data.
Some of the potential risk factors regarding data security are:
Fake data generation:You might be collecting false (and so invalid and perhaps damaging) data if you're randomly collecting information from various sources. Any analysis you draw from false or inaccurate data will be tainted.
Unprotected Data resources: Gathering data from  unprotected channels that aren't secure makes your systems are more vulnerable to external attacks


Data silos:
Another significant issue that might arise when working with big data is data silos.You have data silos if all of your data is kept in different databases that don't exchange information with one another. This means that your teams aren't all examining the same data, but rather, they each have access to a little portion of it that is incomplete. Poor execution can result if your teams can only see a piece of the data; this could be the cause of your marketing and sales teams' lack of alignment or your customer care department.It's incorrect interpretation of a customer's wants.
Scalability:
Big data projects can expand and change quickly. It creates a number of difficulties, such as how to manage and carry out numerous tasks so that each workload's objectives may be met affordably.
Integration of data from different sources:
Data is obtained from many different sources in a business, including social media pages, ERP software, customer logs, financial data, emails, presentations, and reports written by staff. Putting all of this data together to create reports is a difficult undertaking.It is a problem that companies regularly neglect. However, perfect data integration is required for analysis, reporting, and business intelligence.
